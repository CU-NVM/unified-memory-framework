	* Version 0.1.0

	This is the first release of Unified Memory Framework (UMF) project.

	UMF is a library for constructing allocators and memory pools. It also contains
	broadly useful abstractions and utilities for memory management. UMF allows
	users to create and manage multiple memory pools characterized by different
	attributes, allowing certain allocation types to be isolated from others and
	allocated using different hardware resources as required.

	Documentation of UMF, including API description, architecture, and examples
	can be found: https://oneapi-src.github.io/unified-memory-framework

	Features:
	- Level Zero memory provider
	- OS memory provider
	- Jemalloc pool (based on jemalloc)
	- Scalable pool (based on oneTBB)
	- Disjoint pool
	- Proxy pool
	- Single-threaded micro benchmark based on ubench and custom multi-threaded benchmark
	- Examples
